This is a simple backbonejs based Map viewer which gets updated when different levels of regions of the countries are selected. It requires the API give the data in a known format for both [unitnames](np.units.json) and [divisions](np.divisions.json).

### Demo

### TODO

* Create country collection and enable caching for countries once loaded
* Simplify the divisions related code
